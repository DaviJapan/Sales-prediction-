### Buisness Problem: 

Cleaning, exporing, analizing the data to create an accurate and precise prediction of sales


### Data:
Big Mart Sales Prediction: https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-big-mart-sales-iii/

For this dataset, there were 8523 rows and 12 columns

## Methods
The data was prepared, cleaned, and the following processes were perfomed:

## Results
Exploratory Data Analysis

## Here are examples of how to inbeds

## Models Evaluated & Results

- Linear Regression Model (Testing Set):

  - MSE: 1,192,678.8572 
  - RMSE: 1,092.0984 
  - R2: 0.5677
 
- Decision Regressor Model (Testing Set):
  - MAE: 1,027.0770 
  - MSE: 2,168,160.4276 
  - RMSE: 1,472.4675 
  - R2: 0.2141

- Tuned Decision Regressor Model (Testing Set):

  - MSE: 1,118,152.8702 
  - RMSE: 1,057.4275 
  - R2: 0.5947

- The Finale Model Chosen was a `Tuned Decision Regressor Model` with the n_estimators tuned to 5.
- For the testing est on the model, `59.5%` of the variance is y was explanined by x.
- The Mean Absolute Error was of by about `$738.44`.
- The Mean Squared Error was `$1,118,152.87`.
- The Root Mean Squared Error had a calculatino of `1,057.43`.
